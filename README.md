# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Image-Classifier
This is my final submission of intro to machine learning course I took in Dicoding Academy. 
I created my first image classifier that can classify whether the image are rock, paper or scissors. 
I'm using CNN and also improved it by using pretrained model called MobileNetV2. 

## The dataset I use is on this link
