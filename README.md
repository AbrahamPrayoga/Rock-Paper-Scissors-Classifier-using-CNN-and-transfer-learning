# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Image-Classifier
This is my final submission of intro to machine learning course I took in Dicoding Academy. 
I created my first image classifier that can classify whether the image are rock, paper or scissors. 
I'm using CNN and also improved it by using pretrained model called MobileNetV2. 

In order to get 5 stars rating, I need to complete some checkpoints for this project.


## The dataset I use is on this link
